I like dance , chess , collecting stamps , travelling and taking photos .  What kind of dance do you like ?  I like rumba and tango .  Great . I am not interested in Chinese chess . It is too difficult for me .  You can learn Chinese checkers or military chess . Both of them are much easier .  OK , I will try . As for stamp , don't you think it is an expensive hobby ?  Yes , it is . But it is full of fun and knowledge . What about you , what do you like to do as hobby ?  I like gardening . I take care of them everyday . I like those flowers and the swing in my garden . If the weather is nice , I would like to lie on the lawn .  Sounds pleasant . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
