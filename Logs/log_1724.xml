His appetite for sweet treats wasn’t one of them.
After indulging his love of basketball by watching two of Lithuania’s top women’s basketball teams battle in Kaunas on Friday, the Big Baller Brand CEO spoke briefly to the media, only to be whisked away by the appeal of milk and cookies.

“Hey man, I’m trying to get some milk and cookies right now. That’s why I’m trying to rush you guys, man,” he said. “I got some milk and cookies waiting on the Baller.”
For what it’s worth, LaVar said he enjoyed the game—an 80-70 win for Hoptrans-Sirenas over Vinius Kibirkštis in LMKL play—and suggested that a women’s team scoring 80 points was “like the boys scoring 100.”
The Big Baller can only hope his boys help Prienu Vytautas score that many points (or more) when they host Lithuanian powerhouse Zalgiris Kaunas in LKL play on Sunday, starting at 7:20 a.m. PT.</convo> <class>official</class></data>
