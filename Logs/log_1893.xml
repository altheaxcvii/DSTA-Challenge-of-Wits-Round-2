They are terrible . They are complete waste of time , but my wife disagrees with me .  Actually , what bothers me is the violence . There are far too many detective and police shows .  I couldn't agree with you more . There aren't enough educational programs , and even the news shows are not well done .  You are absolutely right . They are too brief . They don't tell you anything . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
