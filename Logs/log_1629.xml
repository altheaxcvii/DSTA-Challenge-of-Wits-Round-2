So , where are you flying in from ?  From China .  Really ? You don ’ t look very Chinese to me , if you don ’ t mind me saying so .  It ’ s fine . I am actually from Mexico . I was in China on a business trip , visiting some local companies that manufacture bathroom products .  Wow sounds interesting ! Excuse me if I am being a bit nosy but , how old are you ?  Don ’ t you know it ’ s rude to ask a lady her age ?  Don ’ t get me wrong ! It ’ s just that you seem so young and already doing business overseas !  Well thank you ! In that case , I am 26 years old , and what about yourself ?  I am 40 years old and was born and raised here in the good old U . S of A , although I have some Colombian heritage .  Really ? That ’ s great ! Do you speak some Spanish ?  Uh ... yeah .. of course ! </convo> <class>official</class></data>
