You need to eat healthy foods and avoid unhealthy foods .  Sometimes I don ’ t know what the best foods are .  Fresh fruits and vegetables are important , along with protein and whole grains .  What things should I avoid ?  You don ’ t want to eat food that is high in fat . You need to avoid caffeine and sugar .  Beyond diet , what else can I do to be healthy ?  Getting 30 minutes of exercise a day is important . If you smoke , you need to stop .  How about having a beer on the weekend ?  Less than a serving of alcohol a day can actually be good for you . Do not overdo it ! </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
