Actually , my office is right around the corner .  It was great to meet you last week at the conference . I really enjoyed our conversation about foreign investment .  Yeah , yeah , it was really interesting . You know , I'm in a bit of a hurry , but here ’ s my card . We should definitely meet up again and continue our discussion .  Sure , you still have my contact details , right ?  You know what , this is really embarrassing , but your name has just slipped my mind . Can you remind me ?  Sure , my name is Ana Ferris . Don ’ t worry about it . it happens to me all the time . I ’ m terrible with names too . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
