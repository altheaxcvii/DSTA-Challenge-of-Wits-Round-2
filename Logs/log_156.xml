It's a young professionals event that serves light appetizers and drinks prior to the show.  Networking starts at 6 pm and the show starts at 8 pm. \n\nAs for the venue, it was a great space and stadium seating ensures that all seats can see the stage below - which is a huge plus for me since I'm short!\n\nI almost forgot how much I enjoy plays and I hope to see shows here more often!  Don't delay as I did and check out a show here sooner rather than later.</convo> <class></class></data>
