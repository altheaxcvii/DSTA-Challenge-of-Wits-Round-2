Yesterday . I didn't even know it was coming . He just told me he found someone else .  What a jerk . He doesn't deserve you .  But it still hurts . I thought I loved him .  He didn't treat you that well either . Maybe you don't want to hear this , but I think you can do better .  Better or worse , it doesn't matter . I had a lot of feelings for him . I really liked him  It must be really painful . I remember when Josh and I broke up . I was crying for a week .  I know . I'll get over him . My first break up was painful because I was naive .  Exactly . You'll find someone again . You should get your mind off of this . Let's go shopping .  Maybe tomorrow . I don't feel like it tonight .  How about coffee down the street ?  Sure . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
