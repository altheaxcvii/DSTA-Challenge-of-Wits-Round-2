My paycheck that just arrived is less than last week ’ s check .  Did you work at all during the last pay period ?  Yes , actually , I did make a little bit of money .  Did you report it on your Continued Claim Form ?  Yes , I showed that income on the Continued Claim Form .  Well , we deducted a portion of the income that you made from this week ’ s check .  Maybe I just shouldn ’ t show the income then .  That is cheating and , if you get caught , you will be fined and disqualified from collecting unemployment . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
