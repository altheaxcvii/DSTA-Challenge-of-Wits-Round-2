I don ’ t have much contact with them .  Really ? Why not ? Don ’ t you go up and talk to them ?  No , I don ’ t . I ’ m too afraid of making mistakes in English . I don ’ t want to be laughed at .  You won ’ t get anywhere that way . You ’ re the one who needs to practice English , so you should make the first move . Besides , most American students are really friendly and outgoing . They will be glad to talk to you .  Thanks for the advice . I guess you ’ re right . It ’ s just hard to overcome my shyness . I really will try from now on . I promise . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
