Can you tell me how to make it run faster ?  If you want to speed up your system , you ’ Ve got to clean it up first .  How ?  You need to free your disk space . The simplest way is to use a Disk-Cleanup tool to remove temporary files and in store programs that you no longer use . Things should be fine next time you start . You also need to control what starts up . There is a program calls Start-up Delayer , It can help to set after how much time programs should be loaded after Windows boosts . For example , you can choose to set your Fox Mail program to load 30 seconds after Windows starts up .  Very useful advice , I will try them right now . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
