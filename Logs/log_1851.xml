I've seen that movie , too .  How did you like the movie ?  I thought it was pretty good .  Really ? I can't say I agree .  You're kidding . The story and acting were outstanding .  I guess I expected too much from the movie , so I was a bit disappointed .  I guess it could happen . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
