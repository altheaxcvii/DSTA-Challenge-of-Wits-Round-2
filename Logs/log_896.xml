If it were up to Tom , we'd have the wedding in the ETV ? He loves to sing .  Then I bet he's really good !  Well , uh , I'll let you decided that for you yourself . He'll be here a little later . Here's our room .  This is where we sing ? These booths are so comfortable I think could fall asleep !  Let's order something to eat . What are you in the mood for ?  It's up to you .  OK .
