<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>277,50</location> <convo>I've had fish sandwiches all over Pittsburgh, it's a staple of the burgh diet and one of the dishes we do best.  Sadly Wiener World does it worst.  A bad fish sandwich in Pittsburgh is like bad BBQ in Texas or a bad cheesesteak in Philadelphia, an offensive abomination that denigrates the pride and reputation of the region.  I have never had a worse fish sandwich anywhere (including in fast food hole in the walls) and at $10, this assault on your taste buds doesn't come cheap.\n\nIt was bad in every way it could be bad.  Frozen, greasy, tasteless, heavy on bland batter and light on fish.  To add to it, even though the inside of the establishment is large, there are no chairs to sit down (just counters), they don't take cards (cash only, but they do have an atm) and the inside was freezing, I was shivering in the 60* temperature even though it was 80 outside in July.  \n\nSo why do they get 2 stars instead of just 1?  My server was very nice, the fries with the sandwich were prepared fresh and were good, and I've heard from many reputable sources that their ice cream is fantastic.  That said, I'll be licking my wounds from disappointment for a while before I lick their ice cream.</convo> <class></class></data>
