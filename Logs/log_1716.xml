I ’ Ve got pork chops , small steaks , chicken wings , and plenty of hot sausages and hamburger patties .  I can ’ t wait to start cooking ! I ’ Ve bought the grill and charcoal . Do you have enough plates and utensils ?  I think so . I bought some paper plates and cups for people to use . It will save on the washing up !  And if people drop them , they won ’ t break . We ’ ll need to buy some buns to make hot dogs and hamburgers .  They sell them at the shop around the corner . We can go and get some in a few minutes .  I brought some cheese to make cheeseburgers and some onions for the hot dogs . We ’ ll need some tomato ketchup and some barbecue sauce .  I have the sauce , but remind me to get some ketchup at the shop .  How long does it take to cook meat on a barbecue ?  It only takes a few minutes . Some people like their meat well done . Others like it rare . The great thing about a barbecue is that everyone can choose how they want their meat cooked .  They can cook it themselves to make sure it ’ s exactly how they like it .  I hope you haven ’ t invited any vegetarians ! </convo> <class>official</class></data>
