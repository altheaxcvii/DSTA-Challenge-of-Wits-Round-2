Well , I wouldn't call them rules , but there are some things that I expect my daughter to do .  Like what ?  Setting the table and doing the dishes .  Is there anything else ?  I also expect Cindy to tidy up her own room .  Her room is very neat and clean .  Yeah . She's a very responsible person .  I will keep my room clean , too . That's a promise . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
