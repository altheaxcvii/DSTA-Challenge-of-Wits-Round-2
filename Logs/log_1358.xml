<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>153,96</location> <convo>Banksville Beer is one of those places I very rarely have to shop at; I don't drink a ton of beer and given a choice between cider (which you can get here) and wine (not so much, obviously), wine will usually win. \n\nAs a result, one stop here can keep my cider/beer supply stocked for months. Now, while I've never left the shop empty handed and I LOVE browsing the fantastic and varied beer selection here, I have admittedly had trouble finding specific favorite beverages of mine, such as flavors of Magner or even varieties of Blue Moon. But I think this has more to do with my taste (remember, not the biggest beer person, more of a cider/wine person) than the shop itself - you can always at least find the basic ciders and beers here. And again, I've never left empty handed despite my snobby tastes: usually I leave with a whole case of Woodchuck, and most recently a whole case of Fall Woodchuck. Yum! Also, the men behind the desk are usually pretty good about asking if you need a hand taking things to your car. (Usually.)\n\nStill, the parking situation here keeps me from giving the place 4 stars. Getting into the lot here can be a little frightening as you hope the person behind you is paying attention and slowing down while you turn into the lot. The lot itself is pretty tiny so problems can arise if too many people stop in for beer at once. Finally, getting out is even more terrifying than pulling in, because no one slows down on Banksville, ever, to let you out. Be prepared to sit for a few minutes if traffic is heavy.\n\nHappy shopping, beer lovers!</convo> <class></class></data>
