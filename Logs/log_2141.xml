<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>231,115</location> <convo>welcome back ! How was your vacation ?  it was fantastic , but I'm glad to be back ! Being a tourist is really tiring !  where did you end up going ?  because it's off-season , we got a really good package deal to Paris , so we went there .  I've always wanted to go to Paris . The Eiffel Tower is one of the most famous tourist attractions in the world ! Did you go to the top ?  that was the first thing we did . I have a few pictures . Do you want to see them ?  sure . What's this one a picture of ?  oh , that's a picture of me on our fourth day of travelling . I'm standing next to a famous foundation in the centre of the city .  you don't look very happy in that picture .  no , by that time , I was sick of sightseeing . I had had enough of art galleries , cathedrals , fountains , statues , and palaces !  so what did you do ?  we spent that afternoon walking around a flea market . We had a few coffees , watched a movie , and went for a swim in the pool at the hotel .  my travel agent always reminds me to plan a day of relaxing for every 3 days of sightseeing . Did you go to the Louvre ?  of course ! You can't go to Paris without going to their famous art gallery ! I was surprised by how small the Mona Lisa was though .  that's what everyone says ! I can't wait to see it for myself some day . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
