I acted as a secretary in an insurance company .  Would you tell me the essential qualities a secretary should maintain ?  Well , to begin with , I would say she needs to be diligent , and the second point is that she has to do a lot of things on her own initiative . Finally , she can make notes in shorthand and types and has the skills in report writing , summary writing , keep minutes at meetings , and so on . Most important of all is that she seems to have a better memory than average .  Have you had any experience with computer ?  Yes , I studied in a computer training program , and can process data through the computer .  That's fine . What about operating the fax and duplicator ?  I can handle them without any trouble  What have you learned from jobs you have held ?  Above all , I have learned that what is good for the company is good for me . So I follow the instructions strictly and always keep my boss informed .  Very good . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
