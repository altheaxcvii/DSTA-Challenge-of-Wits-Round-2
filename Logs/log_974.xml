We had a lot of fun there . There was so much joy and walk and breathe the winter air . We arrived at the park at 9 o ’ clock in the morning and didn ’ t leave till 3 o ’ clock in the afternoon .  You had been walking for 6 hours , isn ’ t that boring ?  Of course not ! We built a snowman , some snow dogs and one big snow fort . We went sliding on the nice hill . It was a real work out . At noon , we had the most special winter picnic outside . Fortunately , we got it all on a video tape . You must come with us next time . I bet you will love it .  Well . You know I hate walking , but I can ’ t wait to see your guys ’ video . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
