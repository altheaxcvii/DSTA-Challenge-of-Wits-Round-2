6:30 p.m.
The White House has some extra help in the kitchen for the state dinner honoring the president of France.
Former National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton is lending his skills to the occasion Tuesday night.
Anton is known for being particularly talented in the kitchen. In fact, White House spokeswoman Sarah Huckabee Sanders cited his "amazing chef" skills in a statement earlier this month on his departure. The White House is serving rack of lamb for the main course.
Anton resigned from the White House just before new national security adviser John Bolton came on board.
He is now a writer and lecturer at Hillsdale College.

5:30 p.m.
Melania Trump is embracing her moment in the spotlight for the French president's state visit.
She traded in her usual dark sunglasses for a white wide-brimmed hat that quickly became a trending topic on social media. She has thrown herself into planning the state dinner for President Emmanuel Macron and his wife, Brigitte. All eyes will be on the former model again Tuesday when she steps out in a designer gown to greet the Macrons as they arrive for dinner.
Seeing the gown is typically the highlight of a state dinner. But for once, it may pale in comparison to the hat.
The hat bobbed up and down across the bottom of TV screens as the first lady took her seat for the president's news conference with Macron.</convo> <class>official</class></data>
