I run or play tennis or do something else like those to get some exercises to keep fit .  Are you introverted or extroverted ?  I wouldn't call myself extroverted . Sometimes , I enjoy being by myself very much . But other times , I like sharing activities with others too , especially during these last few years .  What kinds of sports do you like ?  I like almost all sports , and I enjoy both playing and watching . I especially like tennis and mountain climbing .  What kind of personality do you think you have ?  Well , I approach things very enthusiastically , I think , and I don't like to leave something half-done . It makes me nervous-I can't concentrate on something else until the first thing is finished . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
