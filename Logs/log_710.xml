I don't see anything wrong with what we're doing ! That's just the problem . In these kind of things , the trouble doesn't always appear at first .  But everything has been so easy .  Everything has gone as smooth as clockwork . Just like we planned ! That may be true , but if you were to do it , you would have trouble on the horizon . You always say that .
