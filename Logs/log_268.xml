Please come in !  I am so happy I found this class because I was really nervous about my upcoming interview .  When we go into an interview , what do you think our first consideration should be ?  Our dress and grooming are probably the first thing an interviewer judges us by .  Friendliness and a good attitude are also very important .  Yes , and they help establish a friendly tone for the rest of the interview .  The interviewers always are interested in what you ask them about their company .  What else should I be thinking about ?  Be yourself and be honest . Simply answer the questions put to you . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
