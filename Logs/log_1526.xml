<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>188,168</location> <convo>Good afternoon , it's nice to see you again . Have you decided to go ahead and try for the Fixed Asset Loan ?  I'm going to need some more info first . I was wondering about the repayments . How long would I have to pay back the loan ?  That depends . Our repayment plans go from 1 year to 10 years . The Fixed Asset Loan is a long-term loan , you see . The loan can be paid in either monthly or quarterly instalments , to suit your needs .  And how much is payable in each instalment ?  You will need to pay part of the principle sum and part of the interest due .  Well , as far as I can see , the advantages outweigh the disadvantages . You've sold me ! I'd like to go ahead . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
