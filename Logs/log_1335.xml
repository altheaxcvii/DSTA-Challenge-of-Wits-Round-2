Thank you very much . I ’ Ve tried to keep it short and clear.If there ’ s any questions please feel free to ask me .  Well yes , I do have a number of questions , but perhaps first you could give me a brief overview I ’ d like to get a little bit of an idea of your background .  Yes , of course . Well as you can see from the resume I ’ m 27 and grew up in Brooklyn , New York , although our family moved to London when I was quite young , at around 16 .  Ah I see , so you were actually educated in Europe ?  Yes precisely . Although I was born in the US , I would definitely call London home . But as you see I ’ Ve actually spent a lot of my life moving from country to country . My Father was in the oil business  Very interesting . So it seems you had quite an adventurous childhood .  Absolutely ! We were never still for too long . But now I ’ m really looking to settle down .  I see . Okay , well let ’ s move on to discuss your education shall we ?  Sure . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
