<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>163,111</location> <convo>Can you be serious for a moment , we've been dating for 6 months now , I really like you . I'd like to take a relationship to the next level .  So what are you trying to say to me ?  It feels like you are not dedicate to our relationship . It seems like you treat it as a just casual dating .  How should I say it ?  I don't want to be like this . I think we should get step further .  It has only been 6 months , our relationship hasn't had a chance to maturate . We are still have some hurdle we have to jump over .  Like what ?  Last week I saw Brain kissing you on the cheek .  It was only the cheek .  That is ok , then ? Starts on the cheek ? pretty soon you french kiss in the back on his car .  Oh , that is ridiculous .  So is it ok if I kiss other women on the cheek ?  Definitely not .  You see , we still have hurdle . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
