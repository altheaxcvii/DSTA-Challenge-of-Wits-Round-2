I would say it was a typical run-of-the-mill Hollywood thriller .  Well , I'm no movie expert , but those special effects were impressive by any standards .  Special effects ? Baloney ! That movie was made on a shoestring budget . They've been using trick photography like that for years  Okay . But you have to admit that it was an exciting story , especially with that surprise ending .  You should read the book . The original story is much better and has a different twist at the end .  Oh , really ? How does the book end ?  Read it yourself and find out ! </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
