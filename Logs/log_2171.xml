The theater was impeccably clean and the ushers were very helpful and pleasant.  The Gaffigan show was hilarious. \n\nI was impressed with the upkeep of the theater. Every seat appeared to be a good seat.\n\nI am taking off two stars because a Captain and coke and glass of red wine cost $22.00.</convo> <class></class></data>
