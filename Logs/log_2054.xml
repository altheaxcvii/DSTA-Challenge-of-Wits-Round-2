<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>248,172</location> <convo>I had a terrible journey back from Bangkok last week .  Really ? Why ? What happened ?  Well , first of all , the taxi that was taking me from the client's office to the airport broke down on the freeway .  Oh , no .  Yes , and the driver didn't speak any English or Chinese and he didn't have a phone on him-can you believe it ? - and his radio didn't work . So there was no way he could get in touch with the office to get them to send another taxi .  So what did you do ?  Well , I actually thumbed a lift .  You what ?  Yes , I stood on the side of the freeway and stuck my thumb out , and a passing truck stopped and took me to the airport .  Wow , good for you .  Yes , except he drove really slowly , and I missed my flight .  Oh , no !  Yes , so I had to wait three hours for the next one . I didn't get home till four in the morning , and when I got home I realized I'd left my house keys in my hotel in Bangkok .  You really have bad luck , don't you ?  Seems like it . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
