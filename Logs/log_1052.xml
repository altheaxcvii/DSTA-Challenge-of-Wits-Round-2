I guess I was a little hard on SW the first time around, the food isn't bad, I just think it's overrated. On this trip we got an appetizer sampler - fried mozz and zucchiniI were nothing special, the brushetta was superb and I didn't get to taste the fried ravoli but I didn't hear any complaints from the table. As an entree I had the 4 cheese manicotti which comes with both marinara and alfredo, the dish was good but im not really a fan of their marinara so if I ever find myself revisiting The SW I'll ask for just alfredo. Everyone else at the table had some form of lasagna (veggie, sausage and meat) and again, no complaints. Overall, its a decent family restaurant.</convo> <class></class></data>
