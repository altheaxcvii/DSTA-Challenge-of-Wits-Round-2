One of our other vendors is going out of business and I ’ Ve been searching for a suitable replacement .  Well , rest assured that you can count on us to be here for the long run , sitdown.Coffee ?  No , thanks . I ’ Ve been trying to cut down on the caffeine .  Haha , I could never do that . I ’ d be a zombie if I didn ’ t have my morning coffee fix . Let ’ s get down to business then .  Yes . I ’ Ve come to talk with you about ordering the eight megapixel cameras for our new methone . The demand for phone cameras is growing , and Pear has been falling behind in the market .  That ’ s great ! I ’ m glad to hear that Pear has finally jumped on the bandwagon . Right now our contract is for the five megapixel cameras . Is Pear still interested in having those ?  No , we ’ re changing all the cameras to eight megapixels . We were hoping that by making your company our sole supplier for cameras we could negotiate a better deal .  Surely . Let ’ s get started by drafting a new contract . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
