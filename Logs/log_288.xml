<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>185,161</location> <convo>Do you believe in horoscope fortune-telling ?  I used to be an atheist . But in recent months , I couldn't but form a more favorable opinion of horoscope .  That sounds interesting . Have you been involved in any mystery ?  Not exactly , except that I find horoscope predictions increasingly accurate . I came upon a website which sends me an up-dated message by e-mail each day forecasting my experience in detail . It is amazing to find these forecasts largely in line with my daily life .  What did it say about you then ?  For example , the message for the day before yesterday notified me that I , as a Leo guy , was to have some " unusual experience in food and drink . And as it turned out , the reality matched this prediction well . Lasi night , I was treated to a dinner party by Mr . Lee .  But it must have been only a coincidence . That's the only way superstition wins over science .  Oh , no . You can never tell whether such-and-such is science or sheer fraud.If horoscope is really something deceptive , how come quite a size of proportion of young people think highly of it .  For fun . It serves as a shared topic to them.While they claim to consult the predictions constantly and marvel at their " accuracy ' . they do not necessarily take them seriously . When it that these predictions are matched by their real-life experiences , they delight in spreading the thrill with friends . But if there isn't any correlation between reality and predictions , they just grin , forget about them , and go on living as usual . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
