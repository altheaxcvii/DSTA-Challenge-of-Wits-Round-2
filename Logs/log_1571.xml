If you want to stretch your legs , a good exercise is to lift your knee in front of your body , like this . It ’ s a very simple exercise , but very effective .  I need to excise my arms too . How can I do that ?  One good way is to do push-ups . Another way is to use weights . Make sure you grip the weights firmly . You don ’ t want to drop them on your feet !  When I do push-ups , should I bend my elbows so that my nose touches the ground ?  You don ’ t need to bend your elbows that much . Bend them so that your arms are at a 90 degree angle . The most important think is to remember to keep your body straight . Many people bend their bodies at the waist , which reduces the effectiveness of the exercise .  What ’ s a good exercise for my chest muscles ?  One that I recommend is that you lie on your back . You should have a weight in each hand and stretch your arms out either side of your body .  So I need plenty of space for this exercise .  Yes , you do . Lift the weight up , keeping your arms straight all the time .  Great . Thanks for you advice ! </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
