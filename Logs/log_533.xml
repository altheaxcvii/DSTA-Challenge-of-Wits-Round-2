Tell me about it .  Okay . In the middle of their streets there are parks , big soccer fields as far as you can see .  Really ?  That's not all . They use them ! Every night men , women , children all out there till 3 and 4 a . m .  Are you serious ?  I don't know how they function the next day ! It's like they eat and breathe soccer ! </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
