But I don't know anything about it .  Chinese food is divided into eight big cuisines , such as Cantonese food , Sichuan food , Fujisan food , etc . Our restaurant is famous for Sichuan style .  Is there any difference between Cantonese food and Sichuan food ?  Yes . Cantonese food is lighter while Sichuan food is spicy and hot .  Really ? I like hot food . Can you make a few suggestions ?  How about the eggplant and minced pork in dry red chili sauce and the ' Tofu ' beancurd ? They are our specialties .  OK . I ’ ll have them . Is there any soup ?  Yes . Sour soup of Sichuan style . It's our chef ’ s recommendation .  That ’ s fine . I'll have a try .  Sir , your dish will take 5 minutes to prepare . While waiting , would you like anything to drink ?  Martini , please .  OK , sir . We'll try our best to serve you as soon as possible . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
