Just take your clothes off from the waist up and put the gown on , with the opening in the back .  Then what should I do ?  You will stand over here up against this plate .  Should I just stand naturally ?  You will raise your arms up shoulder high .  Is this all right ?  Yes , you are doing great .  Where will you be going ?  I need to stand behind this shield . Now you will take a deep breath , hold it , and let it out .  Is that it ?  That â€™ s it . You can get dressed when the film is developed . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
