Are you doing anything this weekend ?  I have to work on Saturday all day ! I really hate my job !  Are you available on Sunday ?  Yes , that's my only day off until Thursday .  Ok , well , my friends and I are planning on going to the beach on Sunday . We tend to leave around noon whenever we go anywhere , so you could still sleep in . Do you want to come with us ?  That'd be fantastic ! Which beach are you going to ?  It's a quiet beach just about an hour outside of the city .  What should I bring with me ?  We've got plenty of inflatables , but if you want to sit on a chair , you'll have to bring your own sunlounger .  I can just use my beach towel . I love lazing around in the sun .  Do you like surfing ?  I've actually never tried . Do you have a surfboard ?  We've got a few . I can teach you how to surf on Sunday . It'll be fun !  I can't wait ! It sounds like we're going to have a great time . How much money should I bring ?  You'll just need roughly $ 10 for food and gas money . My friend is driving , so we usually all chip in a few dollars for gas money .  Ok , where and when should I meet you ?  We'll pick you up at your place at noon . Be there or be square ! </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
