He appeals to the fans thanks to two things  You mean he plays well ? Yeah , he often scores by free kicks in crucial games . But a football match is by no means merely a show of taking free kicks .  Certainly not . What really counts is to play as a team , passing the ball amongst each other , dodging defenders . Free kicks are a result of all the teammates ' collective efforts.However , a few free kicks often make everything different , especially scoring one such goal in the nick of time .  In the case , maybe facial charm should be his leading card . After all , the majority of his fans are girls .  Yes , his face looks are manly , with a straight nose and infinite eyes . As a man of medium height in the West , he keeps a powerful but elegant figure , looking neither lanky nor stout .  And he is English ! He makes a model gentleman when he puts on a black suit and speaks with a typical British accent . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
