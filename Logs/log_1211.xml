<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>265,100</location> <convo>STOCKHOLM (AP) â€” Swedish low-cost fashion brand Hennes &amp; Mauritz AB says its fourth-quarter profit fell to 3.99 billion kronor ($506 million), down from 5.91 billion kronor.
Sales during the same period have dropped 2 percent to 50.4 million kronor ($6.4 million) as "the industry changes are challenging everyone and this will continue in 2018."
CEO Karl-Johan Persson says "at the heart of the transformation is digitalization and it is driving the need to transform and re-think faster and faster."
Persson said Wednesday the group's 2017 performance "was mixed," adding there were "difficulties."
In recent weeks, the Stockholm-based group had been accused of racism over an ad showing a black child dressed in a hoodie reading "coolest monkey in the jungle" for which H&amp;M has apologized.</convo> <class>official</class></data>
