As punishment for what it deemed a doping scheme during the 2014 Sochi Olympics, the International Olympic Committee has invited 169 Russians to compete under a neutral flag using the name "Olympic Athletes from Russia."
At a meeting with athletes at his presidential residence outside Moscow, Putin says "I wish you not to think about anything which has recently accompanied your preparation for these Olympics."
He adds that he hopes they "focus on sporting competition, and that you know that following you, as usual, are hundreds of thousands, millions, of fans who love you and hope you win."</convo> <class>official</class></data>
