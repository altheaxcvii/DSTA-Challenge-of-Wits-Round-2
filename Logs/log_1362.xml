Do you have any suggestions ?  Let's see . How about a nice shirt and tie ? You can't go wrong there .  Well . He doesn't wear ties that often .  We have some nice pants . You can also get him a belt with it .  That sounds good . Which one do you recommend ?  These slacks are very popular . He can wear them to dress up a little or on a normal casual day .  I like them . Do you have matching belts ?  Yes . Right over here .  How much are they ?  The pants are on sale for $ 40 , and the belt is $ 25 .  What is your return policy just in case he doesn't like them ?  Just save the receipt and we will gladly return or exchange them for you .  That sounds great . I'll take them . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
