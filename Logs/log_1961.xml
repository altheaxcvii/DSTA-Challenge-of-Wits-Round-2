<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>147,56</location> <convo>Frank Ntilikina is the NBA’s second-youngest player, but the 19-year-old is clearly wise beyond his years. Following the New York Knicks’ 111-107 win over the Atlanta Hawks on Sunday, the rookie known to some as the French Prince tip-toed around questions about any added excitement about matching up with Lonzo Ball when the Los Angeles Lakers come to Madison Square Garden on Tuesday—albeit while leaving room for some understated praise.
“Every game is a different point guard. Every time is a talented point guard,” Ntilikina said. “I mean, this league is just full of very talented point guards, and [Ball] is one. Every game, I’m going to step on that court with the same approach, and just trying to get that win.”
Ntilikina was one of five point guards taken within the top nine slots in the 2017 NBA Draft. The Knicks’ pick at No. 8 came in just ahead of the Dallas Mavericks’ Dennis Smith Jr. (No. 9) and behind Markelle Fultz of the Philadelphia 76ers (No. 1), Ball (No. 2) and De’Aaron Fox of the Sacramento Kings (No. 5).
Through 23 games, the former European pro has averaged 5.5 points on 34.8 percent shooting (28.6 percent from three) with 1.9 rebounds, 3.2 assists, 1.4 steals and 2.0 turnovers in 19.7 minutes. So while certain aspects of Zo’s game may be lacking on their own, he still looks to be ahead of Ntilikina’s curve at the moment.</convo> <class>official</class></data>
