The 56-42 vote Tuesday to confirm David Stras of Minnesota demonstrates anew Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's resolve in getting President Donald Trump's judicial nominees confirmed.
The Republican-led Senate went ahead with a committee hearing and a vote for Stras despite one of his home state senators, former Democratic Sen. Al Franken, declining to return what is referred to as a "blue slip."
Over the years, senators could derail a vote by not returning their blue slip. The last time a judge was confirmed without two blue slips was 1989.
Stras will join the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit.</convo> <class>official</class></data>
