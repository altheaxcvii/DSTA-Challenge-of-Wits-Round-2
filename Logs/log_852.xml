About 12 o'clock , when I came home from work .  Apparently forced entry . The lock is battered to pieces .  I wonder how the burglar did it .  He is so unskillful . I have never seen such an awkward burglar .  That's because we have a strong lock .  Probably . Let's check the inside then .  Did you find anything ?  Yes , the house was in a terrible mess . It was almost turned upside down by the burglar .  Oh , er ... sorry that's because we didn't have time to clean it .  You mean it is not created by the burglar ?  Definitely not , sir . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
