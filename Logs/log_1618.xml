Excellent toppings, excellent food, excellent beer selection. The fries and vegetarian selections are well done, so no one feels left out.\n\nI didn't know about this place until I started getting into trying odd micro-brews and I was looking for some different beers I had while living abroad. The beer cave is an experience and you will not be letdown. I have yet to meet someone who feels that D's is anything less than stellar.\n\nSidenote: I highly recommend D's Sixpax for someone's 21st birthday to pick out a six-pack from their epic selection of brews. (Also, buy them a hot dog, cheapskate!)</convo> <class></class></data>
