It is wedged into a small triangular shaped building.  They are open for lunch and dinner.  Their pizza has been a staple of Downtown since 1980.\n\nTheir specialty pizzas include spinach and feta cheese pizza, a little too oily for my tastes (it's made with an oil and garlic sauce).  A much better choice is Buffalo Chicken Pizza, which is Buffalo sauce topped with cheese and spicy chicken.  The chicken has a nice fresh taste to it and while spicy, is never overdone.\n\nBut I love the hoagies the best here.  My favorite is the tuna hoagie, which is served with cheese, lettuce, tomato, &amp; grilled onions.  I know, break out the Listerine strips after eating one of those.  If I like something a little zestier, I'll get the Capicola or the Genoa Salami hoagie.\n\nThey have a lunch buffet here too.  I've never tried it because I prefer my food made-to-order.</convo> <class></class></data>
