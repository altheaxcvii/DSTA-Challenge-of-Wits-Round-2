What kind is most durable , please ?  Well , here is one made of duralumin . That's cheap and durable . Over there we've also got some made of stainless steel , and those over there are enamel ones .  I'll have the stainless ones . They look very solid .  Yes , sir . Stainless steel products are always popular . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
