I ’ m just fine .  You ’ re almost 70 years old , Mom ! Don ’ t you think it would be better for you if you moved in with us ?  No way ! I like my apartment , and I like to be independent .  Do you ever get lonely living alone ?  Not at all . I see you and your family twice a week , and I enjoy seeing my own friends . I ’ m too busy to feel lonely ! </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
