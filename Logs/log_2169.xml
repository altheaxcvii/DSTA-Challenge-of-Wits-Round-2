The rookie out of UCLA racked up six assists during the first quarter of the Los Angeles Lakers’ road game against the Indiana Pacers at Bankers Life Fieldhouse—none more emphatic than this nifty pick-and-roll dish to Julius Randle for the thunderous slam.

That was one of three assists Randle helped Zo accrue in the period. Coming into this contest, the Kentucky product had accounted for 45 of Ball’s helpers—the fourth-most of any Laker, behind Brook Lopez (68), Kyle Kuzma (53) and Kentavious Caldwell-Pope (49), per NBA.com.</convo> <class>official</class></data>
