<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>207,197</location> <convo>I can't decide whether to go to university or to get a job .  Well , if I were you , I'd go on studying .  But I don't even know what to study .  If I had chance again , I'd major in English . You're good at language .  That's what my parents want me to do .  You should take their advice . They know what's best for you .  But my friends will have jobs and lots of fun , while I spend all my time doing reading and writing .  But if you go to university , you'll still have time for fun .  Hum , what you say make sense . But you know , I still have to ask my parents for pocket money , and I hate to do so at this age .  And if you try to find a part-time job , you'll have some money too .  You're right . Thank you for the advice . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
