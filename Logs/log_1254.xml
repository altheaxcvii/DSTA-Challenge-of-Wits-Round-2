<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>235,129</location> <convo>This is the house I want to rent .  Could you tell me the advantages of it ?  No problem . First , it's comfortable and cozy . Second , it has a lovely view of the city . Third , it has all kinds of electric appliances that we need , such as refrigerator , electric stove , heating apparatus , washing machine and dishwasher . Forth is the most important , the electricity is free of charge . Finally , it's located in the center of the city and the transportation is convenient .  There is something in what you said , but what is the rent ?  200 dollars per week .  In my opinion , the rent is far more expensive than that in other areas .  It certainly is . But to tell you the truth , the room is so large that I can share it with someone else , and that will decrease the total amount of the rent .  Your intention is good , but I still can't agree with you . If no one would like to share it with you , you have to pay it all by yourself .  Don't you think I can save some bus fares since it ’ s easy to go anywhere from here and it ’ s near the place where I work ?  I agree with you in this way . But how often do you go to work or shopping per week ?  Twice a week for work and once for shopping .  In my opinion , you have to go to the university every day , and the fare would cost you most of your living expenses if you live here far away from the university .  That's true . Ok , I will think about it . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
