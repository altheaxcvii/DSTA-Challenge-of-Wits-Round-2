A new two-bedroom apartment , around 100 to 120 square meters , in the Sanlitun area .  What about the surrounding area ?  Very quiet and safe . And it's got a lot of trees and plants .  That's good . Is the location easily accessible ?  Yeah , it's near a bus stop .  Hmm ... well , maybe we can buy this one then . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
