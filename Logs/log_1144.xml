<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>176,82</location> <convo>This place is no longer the cool hole-in-the-wall place to get a hot dog and beer (from a good selection).  They've expanded and that is both good and bad in my mind.  I liked the small, personal feel to the old place, but it definitely limited how many people who could be in the shop at a time.  So, now they have a much more extended seating area with a bar area and a back room devoted to brews.  I brought my friends here who like beer, and they were ecstatic to find a fave beer that they haven't been able to find anywhere in the DC area.  (Go Pittsburgh!).  The selection is nice and its good to see that I can find those out of the way beers so that I don't have to get just the norm from a beer distributor.  \n\nThe hot dogs?  None of us were gushing about them afterward.  But they're ok.  4 stars for the beer selection.</convo> <class></class></data>
