<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>268,98</location> <convo>GENEVA (AP) â€” A group of U.N. human rights experts are expressing concerns about the health of the widow of late Nobel Peace Prize laureate Liu Xiaobo, saying the Chinese government should let her seek treatment wherever she wishes.
The independent experts commissioned by the U.N.'s Human Rights Council reiterated their call to Chinese authorities to indicate where Liu Xia is being held, and to release her.
The U.N. rights office says she has been under house arrest since 2010, when her husband won the Nobel prize. He died in custody last year.
The experts say Liu Xia reportedly suffers from "severe psychological distress," pointing to audio recordings released in May in which she pleads for help.
She was last seen in public at his funeral, accompanied by authorities.</convo> <class>official</class></data>
