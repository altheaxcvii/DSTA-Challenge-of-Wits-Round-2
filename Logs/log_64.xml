<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>214,228</location> <convo>Hi , I am so glad to see you .  Are you kidding me ? Why do you say so ?  You know , I'm about to graduate and I have to look for a job as soon as possible . But I haven ’ t the faintest idea of how to go about finding a job .  OK . Let me see where to start .  I guess first I should prepare a resume , right ?  Sure . You should include your name , address and phone number in your resume .  Then what else should I put into my resume ?  Your job objectives , of course . In other words , what kind of job are you searching for ?  I got it . Then I should mention my educating background and working experience , should I ?  Yes . And don't forget to list them by date . Besides , you should begin with the most recent and then move backward .  I see . Is that all there is to it ?  No , it's also necessary to list a few related interests that are in some way connected to the jobs you want to take .  Oh , good point . You mean here I should show off my special skills and talents to impress the boss .  You said it . At last you ’ d better attach a list of references to your resume .  That's easy .  And one more thing , smile widely . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
