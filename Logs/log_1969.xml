<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>247,180</location> <convo>I am very nervous about signing my escrow papers .  Escrow involves a lot of paperwork , but I will explain all of the steps to you as we go along .  What should I have brought with me ?  The only thing I will need to see is your driver ’ s license , as I will be notarizing these papers .  I feel a little overwhelmed by so many papers .  Don ’ t worry about how many papers there are . We are going to look at them one at a time .  My boyfriend is an attorney and told me that I could fax him anything if I had a question .  Please get any outside help that you need in understanding your escrow documents .  Is this the last thing that I will need to do before the house becomes mine ?  At the close of escrow , the house will be yours ! </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
