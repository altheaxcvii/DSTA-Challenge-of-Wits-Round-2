You know Miao Li-my roommate , he bought a computer last month . He has turned his computer into an electronic playground . He plays football , rides horses , drives racing cars , and does a whole bunch of other games . Every night he keeps me up .  Don't you like games  I usually get a lot of information on the computer and use E-mail to send messages to my friends .  Me too . Recently , I've made many friends on the net . Every day I talk to them and share many interesting things with them .  Don't you think it's a sheer waste of both time and money ?  I'm afraid not . To me getting in touch with each other has more fun than the coolest computer games or the hottest information .  Yes . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
