Their offices were very impressive , especially their company Logo which is all over the place . There are Logo models in metal , copper , clove , paper . They are even printed on the wall paper and the balls of the table-lights . It is really decorated identity .  It is just too much . Don â€™ t you feel it is an exaggerating style to decorate offices in that way ?  Not at all ! I like the design so much . The designer must have thought really hard to come out with such a brilliant concept .  Well , I doubt that . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
