Yes.It ' s sometimes scary if you think of the tremendous amount of media we face every day .  It's like information overload , not to mention the reliability of these papers and magazines .  Which financial magazines and newspapers do you think do the best job of checking facts ?  Well , for example , The Wall Street Journal is very , very good . Even though it's used on occasion ( as all news organizations are ) by Ces or bankers who leak their mergers in advance in order to get a positive spin .  I like to read Fortune .  Good . Fortune is usually ahead of the curve.And Business Week is very solid , too .  Where does a broadcast company get most of their information ? I hope it's not just from press releases .  A good broadcast company usually does far more than press releases.Their people go out and do real reporting , talking to people at the stock exchange , fund managers , analysts , etc .  But sometimes when a flimsy report , or even a rumor gets on television , there's going to be a terrible ' echo chamber ' effect .  You are right about that . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
