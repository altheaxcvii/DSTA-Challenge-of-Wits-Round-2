That may sound dumb but as someone who frequents hotels &amp; their restaurants it can easily go either way. I've found you can get a great read on a place by the vibe of a hotel lounge. \n\nI hope for Pittsburgh this is not the case. Did I expect more from a Westin? Yes. Am I surprised? No.\n\nSub-par sushi. Tasted like takeout from Wegmans (holler, Rochester!). My Sauv Blanc was room temp &amp; obviously an old bottle because it tasted nothing like it should (Kim Crawford is my standby so this was extra disappointing). Walk across the street &amp; check out the Tonic Bar, I wish I had.</convo> <class></class></data>
