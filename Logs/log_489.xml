Besides the story was so boring that it put me to sleep .  I noticed that , it was not exciting as I expected , but the music was great . I'm always found Jazz . And that movie had a lot of Jazz .  I know . However , Jazz always annoys me . I really don't enjoy music in a movie .  I'm sorry to hear that.What kind of movie do you like ?  Anything with a lot of action , I like thrillers and chillers .  Oh , I see .  Well , I enjoy the popcorn and being with you.You ' re more important than the movie .  Thanks for the sweet words .  Any time . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
