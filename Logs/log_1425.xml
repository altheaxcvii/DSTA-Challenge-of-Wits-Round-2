Just click on News &amp; Links and then on Customer Review http://www.ullrichshoerepair.com/newslinks.htm  Like Steve Martin in \"The Jerk\" when he finds his name in the phone book, I guess I'm somebody now!  \n\nAll kidding aside, Ullrich's came in handy last week.  I broke a heel and they did a great job repairing it.  They've resoled Rick's shoes, repaired a tear in his leather jacket, and repaired one of my purses.  We've always been happy with their work.</convo> <class></class></data>
