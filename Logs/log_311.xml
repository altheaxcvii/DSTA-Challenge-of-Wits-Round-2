I could not exactly say I am a fan of the owner or how he earned his money but I did appreciate how original the house and belongings are and how beautiful the grounds and buildings are.   Can you say Johnstown flood?  How about the Homestead strike?  Celebrating the extreme wealth of few on the backs of a billion who worked 16 hour days for nothing isn't exactly something I really love to do but I can appreciate beautiful art and architecture of which there is plenty to see here.  We toured Clayton (the home), art museum, conservatory and the car and carriage museum.  The conservatory didn't have a lot of impressive specimens and was far from full but is a great building.  Be sure to earmark about 4 hours for the whole experience including, perhaps, a pricey but tasty snack at the cafe (make a reservation).  We had a really nice time and I do recommend a visit if you are here so you can not only see some great furnishings but so that you may learn some of the history of the economy here.  After all, we shouldn't turn our backs on the reality of our collective history lest we make the same mistakes again.  I am glad they are doing such a fine job preserving this place for generations to come.</convo> <class></class></data>
