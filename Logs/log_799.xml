They have done a very good job this time .  I'm glad our booth is on the first floor . More people can see our display .  If someone wants to find us , they can look at this floor plan.It shows where all the companies have their booths .  Let me see that . I didn't get one when I came in .  Really ? They didn't give you one with your ticket ?  No .  That's strange .  Where do you go for lunch around here ?  Are you hungry ?  Not too bad . But I will be soon .  I went across the street . There is a good Chinese restaurant next to the hotel .  I can't see Cortex on this floor plan . Don't they have a booth here ?  They must . Let me look at that.Here it is . Cortex . It's on the second floor , next to the Roll booth .  Oh , that will be uncomfortable for them .  For whom ? Cortex ?  Yes . Cortex just stole Darren McDowell from Rolly.And probably Darren will be here.So he will have to spend the whole show standing next to his old Cortex coworkers .  I've never met Darren.But you're right . That would probably be uncomfortable .  When you reserve a booth , you should check who your neighbors will be.Don ' t you think ?  Yes , maybe . If you're Darren McDowell , you should probably check .  Yes . Well , I think I'll go get lunch . Will you join me ?  No , I'll stay here at the booth . I ate earlier . Are you going to the Chinese restaurant ?  Maybe . I will look around . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
