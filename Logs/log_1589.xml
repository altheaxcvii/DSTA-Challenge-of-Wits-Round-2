What kind of magazine is it ?  It's instructive and inspiring .  Really ? It is a weekly , isn't it ?  No , it's a semimonthly .  Does it enjoy popularity among the young generation ?  Yes , it's so popular that it's sold out as soon as it reaches the bookstores .  Oh , I think I should try to read one . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
