He was happy to return the favor when he returned with the senior-laden and 22nd-ranked Rams on Friday night.
E.C. Matthews scored 18 points, Jared Terrell had 16 and URI beat VCU 81-68 for its 14th consecutive victory.
''I thought we were really, really sharp, particular our passing,'' Hurley said. ''We're just a veteran team that took advantage of our experience. We out-seniored them, out-experienced them.''
Cyril Langevine added 12 points and a career-high 18 rebounds for the visiting Rams (19-3, 11-0 Atlantic 10) in a matchup of teams with the same nickname. The winning streak is the program's longest since the 1939-40 Rams won 15 straight.
Rhode Island also stretched its road winning streak in conference games to 11, the longest such streak in program history.
''It's a lot of things,'' said Matthews, one of four seniors in the starting lineup. ''Being resilient. The non-conference games we had earlier in the season is why we play the way we do now. Having older guys, we kind of set the tone.''
Justin Tillman scored 22 points to lead VCU (14-9, 6-4), which dropped out of a three-way tie for second place in the conference. Sean Mobley added 15, all in the first half. The home Rams trailed just 41-38 at halftime, but couldn't overcome being beaten 47-31 on the boards and outscored 26-6 on second-chance points as URI gradually took control after halftime.
''We felt they were going to try to come out and bully us and control the game and come out hard from the start, so we tried to come out with energy,'' Tillman said. ''I thought we did that in the first half. ... We kept letting them get second-chance rebounds and they were scoring off those.''</convo> <class>official</class></data>
