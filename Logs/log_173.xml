The Indian Space Research Organization says the nano satellites — those weighing less than 10 kilograms (22 pounds) — were taken on board its polar satellite launch vehicle in southern India and sent into orbit on Wednesday.
The agency says the launching of the 104 satellites is a record, overtaking Russia's feat of sending 37 satellites in a single launch in 2014.
The nano satellites belong to various companies in the United States, the United Arab Emirates, Israel, the Netherlands and Kazakhstan, according to the ISRO.</convo> <class>official</class></data>
