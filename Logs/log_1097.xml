Federal prosecutors in New Jersey say 65-year-old Iselin resident Sat Verma was sentenced Tuesday to a year in prison. He had pleaded guilty to access device fraud.
Qaiser Khan, of Valley Stream, New York, received a six-month sentence. The 53-year-old Khan had pleaded guilty to conspiracy to commit bank fraud.
Prosecutors say Verma and Khan were among 22 people convicted in a scheme to create and use more than 7,000 false identities to obtain tens of thousands of credit cards.
The scheme caused more than $200 million in losses to businesses and financial institutions.</convo> <class>official</class></data>
