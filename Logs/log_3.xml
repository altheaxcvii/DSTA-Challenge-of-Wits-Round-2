It is a combination of how much you eat , the type of food you eat , and when you eat your meals .  I never eat breakfast though .  That's a big mistake , you should always have a good breakfast . You will not run your car without fuel , and yet you won't expect your body to work without food .  I never thought about it that way .  I bet you eat a large evening meal , then sit and watch TV or read a book . Then instead of burning off your energy , your body stores it as fat .  Oh doctor , I feel so foolish .  Well control is really using common sense when you plan your eating habits .  I know doctor , thank you so much . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
