In fact , the recommendation is a way of indirect self-recommendation . The university and the business have a long-term relationship . If you are recommended by your university , you can be approved more easily .  But I doubt the authority because most of the recommendation letters of the university are the same .  More and more people have the same discoveries since most of the universities do that in order to save effort . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
