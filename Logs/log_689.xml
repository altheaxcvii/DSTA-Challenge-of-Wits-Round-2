Yeah , clearly blue sky.But it is a bit too hot for me . I don't like heat and humidity .  It's not that hot . It's cooler than yesterday . Let's go swimming !  That's a thought . It's still early , and the beach isn't crowded at this time of the day . If we don't stay too long , we won't get sunburned .  Yeah , sounds like fun . I can wear my new pink bikini .  There won't be anyone there to appreciate how cute you are .  Who cares ! Well , the smart guys get there early . That's the kind of guy I want to meet . Let's go !  If you are going to husband hunting in a bikini , then I want to wear one , too .  Ok , you could borrow one of mine .  Thanks , how about the green and black one ?  No problem . Here it is . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
