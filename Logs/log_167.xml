Of course , I deposit and withdraw money quite often . I often use my ATM card to take money out of my current account . I use my bank to exchange money from once currency to another . I often travel abroad , you see .  Do you ever ask you bank for traveller ’ s cheques ? They are much safer than carrying lots of cash around .  I sometimes use traveller ’ s cheques , but sometimes I travel to countries where they are hard to exchange for cash .  Do you use your bank to pay your utility bills ? I use direct debit .  Yes , I do . It save me a lot of time . I also have standing orders for my subscriptions to magazines .  That ’ s good idea . You don ’ t need to worry about missing an issue of a magazine if you do that . I suppose you have a mortgage too .  Yes . My bank offers very good terms and conditions on mortgage . There ’ s a lot of competition between banks nowadays . Each one is trying to offer better conditions and services than the others .  I have a deposit account with my bank . There are some restrictions on withdrawing money , but the interest rate is much higher .  I don ’ t have one . I prefer to buy shares . My bank also provides a share trading service . It ’ s cheap and easy to use .  That ’ s great . But I prefer to put my money somewhere where the returns are more certain . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
