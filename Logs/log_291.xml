Could you tell me the particulars ?  I told you that we want first-class goods . So the quality , specification and price are clarified in our contract . Do you remember those details ?  Yes , I do .  The re-examination results indicate that one-third of the goods are not up to standard .  Really ? We began to load the goods after we made sure they were qualified .  I told you the truth . According to the contract , if you fail to honor the contract , we are entitled to cancel it . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
