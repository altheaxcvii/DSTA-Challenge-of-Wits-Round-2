Ah , yes , I haven't decided yet .  Don't hesitate . That's a very famous university which a lot of students are longing to attain .  Maybe you are right . But the major is not fit for me . I like architecture more than computers .  But this chance is really precious .  Well , I know . So I am thinking now .  I hope you can make a clever choice . Anyway , the opportunities around you are not that By .  Thank you for your kindness . I will think about it carefully . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
