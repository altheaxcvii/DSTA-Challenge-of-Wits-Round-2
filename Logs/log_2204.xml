<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>244,219</location> <convo>The location of Redfin Blues is great! It overlooks the river, and makes for a lovely place to hang out and have a few drinks... However, the food and service is sub par. Each time that I have been here, whether it be an extremely bustling Saturday evening, or a slow weekday afternoon, the service has been poor. The food is average, and is way overpriced. There are many other great places in Pittsburgh to go if you want a yummy fish sandwich. \n\nRedfin Blues has the potential to be such a great restaurant! But with the poor service and average food, it has a lot to yearn for.</convo> <class></class></data>
