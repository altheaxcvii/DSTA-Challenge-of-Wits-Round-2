Let me see ... You still have ten days annual leave left , is that right ?  Yes . I was wondering if I could take another two weeks off .  That's long leave . How's your project coming along ?  The project I'm in charged of now will be done by the end of this week . I'd like to take my leave from next Monday on .  Well , all right . But you make sure to tie up loose ends before you leave .  Thank you , Mr.Black . There are no immediate projects coming up at the moment . Mr.Smith will be in charge during my absence . He is taking part in several projects as my assistant and knows how to maintain relationships with our clients .  Great ! I hope you have a good relaxation and come back refreshed .  I will . Many thanks , Mr.Black . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
