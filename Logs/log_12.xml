You don ’ t think he ’ s seeing someone else , do you ?  Come on , don ’ t be so dramatic ! I ’ m sure everything is going to work out just fine .  You think so ? Oh , no ! How can he do this to me ? I ’ m sure he ’ s cheating on me ! Why else wouldn ’ t he call ?  But , you two are on a break . Theoretically he can do whatever he likes .  He ’ s the love of my life ! I ’ Ve really messed this up .  Come on , hon . Pull yourself together . It ’ s going to be alright .  But I ... I still love him ! And it ’ s all my fault ! I can ’ t believe how immature and selfish I was being . I mean , he is a firefighter , it ’ s not like he can just leave someone in a burning building and meet me for dinner . I ’ Ve totally messed this up !  You know what , Veronica , I think you should make the first step . I ’ m sure he ’ ll forgive you ...  No , this is not gonna happen ! I ... I ’ Ve ruined everything ...  do you hear something ? </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
