I went out last night with Trevor , and things got a little out of hand .  Nice ! So , where did you guys go ?  We hit a couple of local bars , and met up with some friends . Everything was cool until Mike came along , and it turned out that it was his birthday yesterday !  Oh no ! Mike ’ s birthday is a drinkfest for sure !  Tell me about it ! We drank everything in the bar !  Is that why you missed work today ?  Yeah . I woke up this morning feeling really nauseous . I threw up like five times .  Www !  I was so dehydrated that I drank like a gallon of water , and my head has been pounding all day . I swear , I ’ m never gonna drink again !  Too bad man , tonight is Tracy ’ s going away party and she asked if you were gonna go .  Oh , yeah . I ’ m there ! </convo> <class>official</class></data>
