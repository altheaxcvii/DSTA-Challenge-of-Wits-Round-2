The store was unable to confirm when it will reopen.
A Spokesperson for the Co-op, said: “Our Stanbridge Road store suffered extensive damage when it was struck in the early hours of this morning (Monday, 19 March) by a digger.
“It is too early to confirm when the store will re-open, as we await the outcome of structural reports.
“We apologise to the community for any inconvenience caused by the store’s temporary closure, and we appeal for anyone with information to come forward to the Police, who are investigating.”
