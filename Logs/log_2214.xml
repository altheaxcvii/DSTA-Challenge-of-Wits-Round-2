Can you imagine any thing nearer perfect beauty than she altogether-face and figure ?  I do not know what I could imagine , but I confess that I have seldom seen a face or figure more pleasing to me than hers .  Such an eye ! The true hazel eye-and so brilliant ! Regular features , open countenance , with a complexion , Oh ! What a bloom of full health , and such a pretty height and size ; such a firm and upright figure ! There is health , not merely in her bloom , but in her air , her head , her glance . One hears sometimes of a child being ' the picture of health ' ; now , she always gives me the idea of being the complete picture of grown-up health . She is loveliness itself . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
