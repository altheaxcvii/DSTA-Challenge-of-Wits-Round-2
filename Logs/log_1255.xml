Well , he looked sharp and he came across as a very confident guy .  Okay , what about the first woman ?  She looked a little rough around the edges but had great skills .  All right , and what about the older gentle ?  He was very distinguished , maybe a bit over-qualified .  Ohhhh . I hate this part of my job .  Why don't you go over the resumes again ? They might help you decide who to hire . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
