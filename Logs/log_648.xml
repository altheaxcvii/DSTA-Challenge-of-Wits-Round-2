<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>251,159</location> <convo>Yesterday I had a quarrel with my roommate . I'm really fed up with all this .  Tell me what seems to be the problem .  My roommate always brings a lot of friends from off-campus . They stay in the room until midnight , singing and talking , drinking and playing cards while I have no place for study . I even don't have the quietness to sleep .  Did you ever talk to him about it ? </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
