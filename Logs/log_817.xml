It saves us from so much work and makes the communication even around the world much easier .  Fully agree . I do enjoy the convenience though I am still a beginner in using Excel . The latest office equipment is more type-functional . It combines fax machine , copy machine and printer in one . It saves a lot of place one machine instead of three .  Yes , this machine is even smaller than those before .  When will we get one of those ?  You know our boss always trying to save the last penny . We have to use up the equipment first . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
