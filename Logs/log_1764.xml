We started organizing everything early to avoid a last minute rush to get things done .  When will your wedding take place ?  At ten o'clock on the morning of next Sunday . We have invited all our relatives to the wedding .  It will be a large church one . Is your wedding dress ready ?  Yes , its design is very elaborate and the designer took many weeks to make it .  You will be very beautiful on your wedding day .  Thank you !  Which hotel will the reception be held at ?  The Palace Hotel .  It's excellent . A friend of mine had her wedding reception there and said it was perfect , though very expensive .  It will be expensive , but we think it will be worth .  I think you made the right decision . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
