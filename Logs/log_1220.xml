What am I being tested for ?  Your doctor wants to know what your white blood cell count is .  What does my white blood cell count tell him ?  Usually if your white count is off , the doctor suspects an infection .  How much will it hurt ?  It is only a pin prick . I have to put this tourniquet on your arm to make the vein easier to find .  Is that my blood going into that tube ?  That blood that just filled the tube is all that I needed . Thanks for coming in ! </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
