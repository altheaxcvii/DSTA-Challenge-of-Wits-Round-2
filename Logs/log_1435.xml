<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>206,117</location> <convo>Have the owners answered back with a counter-offer for my offer to purchase the house ?  In response to your offer , the sellers have decided to counter-offer three hundred and thirty-five thousand dollars .  That sounds pretty good to me , but I am not sure what to do .  You can accept this offer or decline it and come up with another offer .  If I make another offer and they refuse , then what ?  Personally , I would consider making one more offer , but it is up to you to decide what to do .  Let â€™ s try going with three hundred and thirty thousand dollars for a counter-offer .  I will contact the sellers with your current offer .  Do you think that this will move along fairly quickly ?  Usually the response to the second offer moves along a bit more quickly than the first one . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
