<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>289,56</location> <convo>Hi . I ’ m here for flight 513 to New York but I thought I heard the paging system announce that it is canceled . Is that true ?  I ’ m terribly sorry , sir , but I ’ m afraid it is true . That flight has been canceled . Would you like to try to book tomorrow ’ s flight ?  No way ! I worked very hard so that I could leave on today ’ s flight . Are there seats on another airline ?  It ’ s possible . If you would like to book with another airline the line is right over there .  You mean the line over there of about 200 people ? !  That ’ s the one . It seems that everyone is anxious to get to New York tonight .  This is a rotten way to start a vacation . I HATE lines ! Can you book me on tomorrow ’ s flight ?  Certainly . You will also be receiving a 50 % discount as our way of apologizing for the inconvenience . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
