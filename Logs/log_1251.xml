So , what do you think about the place ? Are you glad that you moved in ?  It's great ! Unfortunately , we're going to spend a fortune doing everything up .  How old is the house then ?  It's about 200 years old . It has a lot of history !  Sounds fascinating . Where is your new house located ?  It's just off of the ring road .  Do you have a big yard ?  It's bigger than our last one . I've got flowers in the front , and fruits , vegetables and a fish pond in the back .  Is your house well-lit ?  Oh , yes . Our windows let plenty of natural light in . They've also got wonderful views of the park behind our house .  How many rooms does your house have ?  Right now , there are three bedrooms , two barrooms , a kitchen , a sitting room , a dining room , and a living room . We're hoping to add on a green room and a guest bedroom . In fact , when the guest bedroom is ready , you should come and stay with us for a weekend .  I'd be up for that ! </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
