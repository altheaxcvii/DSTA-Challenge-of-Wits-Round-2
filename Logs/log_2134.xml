<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>237,228</location> <convo>do you believe in UFO's ?  sure . A UFO is just a space vehicle from another planet . If you think about it , our space shuttles are UFOs .  I've never thought about it like that before .  I've seen photos of UFOs in America before , but they've all looked doctored up .  do you think that there's life on other planets ?  I think there must be .  why is that ?  I don't't think it would make sense if we were the only beings in this whole world . The world is just far too big for that .  do you think that there's intelligent life trying to contact us ?  no , but we're trying to contact them .  I suppose you're right .  I think that countries are working hard to find a planet that we can live on in the future so that when global warming destroys this planet , humankind will not become extinct .  do you really think that global warming Wil destroy Earth some day ?  there's a lot of evidence that suggest it will , but I don't think it's going to happen any time soon . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
