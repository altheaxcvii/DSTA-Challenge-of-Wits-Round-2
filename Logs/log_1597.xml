Eric is the most popular kid in school ! Okay , my turn . What would you do if you won the lottery ?  Let â€™ s see ... If I won the lottery , I would buy two tickets for a trip around the world .  If you buy me a ticket I will go with you for sure !  My dad will freak out if I even mention a trip like that !  Alright this is a good one . What would your mom say if you told her you are going to get married ?  If I told her that , she would faint and have me committed ! </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
