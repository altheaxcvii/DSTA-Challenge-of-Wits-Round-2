Attorney Cristiano Zanin said in a statement on Tuesday that da Silva asked a court in the capital of Brasilia to prevent a lower court from ordering an arrest until further appeals are heard.
A three-judge panel last week unanimously upheld da Silva's corruption and money laundering conviction and raised his sentence from nine and a half to 12 years and one month in prison.
Da Silva is accused of being promised an apartment as a payoff from a construction company in return for contracts. He denies any wrongdoing and says the trial was rigged.</convo> <class>official</class></data>
