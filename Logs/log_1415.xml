<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>224,205</location> <convo>Betty , would you please read this letter of application I've just written ? I'd like to have your opinion .  I'd be glad to tell you what I think .  Good ! I'm interested in your advice .  If I were you , I would change the beginning . You should write about your education first because we like to judge a man by his abilities .  Good idea , Betty . What would you think about the second part ?  I think it's too short . You'd better say something about your work experience .  You're right , I'll change it . How about the last part ?  Very good . But you should talk about your family , too .  I agree . I appreciate your helping me . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
