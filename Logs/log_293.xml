<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>214,132</location> <convo>Tiffany , why are more and more people turning to the Web to find a mate ?  I think that , as more people use the Internet for both work and pleasure , it makes more sense as a tool to connect with people , and the stigma of meeting someone online is reduced .  There are actually special sites for people looking to date within their specific ethnic group and age group . But how should you screen potential mates ? Do you suggest talking to them on the phone right away or communicating via e-mail ?  I would say do not make the e-mail exchange too long . A lot of times a connection via e-mail creates almost a false sense of intimacy . Quickly make sure there is a connection in the physical world .  Can you give us any other safety tips for people pursuing relationships on the Net ?  I'd suggest you not give out too much personal information , like your home address , until after several dates . Just keep up the same guards you would keep up if you were meeting any stranger .  Besides the growth of these matchmaker sites , do you have any stats on success rates ? Are people out there finding true and lasting love through the Internet  Well , for a site like ecrush.com , since their debut in Valentine's Day in 1999 , of the 1.5 million people who have joined ecrush.com , 300000 have actually matched .  Do you have any successful stories to share ?  Yes , the couple that I highlighted at today's show met on Match.com and they're getting married this summer . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
