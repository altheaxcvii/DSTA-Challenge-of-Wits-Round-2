Follow this road until you get to the traffic lights . You will see a small restaurant at the corner .  Is the restaurant on the right or on the left hand side of the road ?  It is on the right . But it is on the other side of the lights .  OK . Do I turn on the lights or do I go straight ?  You go straight on at the lights , but just past the restaurant building there is a small road to your right .  And do I take that road ?  Yes , you need to turn right and follow that road for about four minutes . You will see the Post Office on your left .  Is there a Post Office sign on the building ?  Yes and it is quite a big building so you won't miss it . There is also a small supermarket next to it .  Thank you very much .  You're welcome . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
