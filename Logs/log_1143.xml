I hope to get some advice from you .  Which country do you want to go to ?  My field is electronic engineering . Which country do you think I should go ?  Were I in your position , I â€™ d go to America .  Which university should I apply to ?  There are many universities for you to choose from . Some famous universities such as Harvard , Yale , the University of Michigan , and Massachusetts Institute of Technology are really wonderful places to study , but they are very competitive and expensive . Some smaller universities or institutes are also very nice but much cheaper .  Oh , I see . Thank you very much . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
