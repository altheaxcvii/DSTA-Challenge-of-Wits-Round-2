I wonder why .  Simple , it's fun .  How much fun is there in singing in front of other people , especially if you don't sing well ?  Ah , that's the biggest fun of all . You see , even though you're not a good singer , people will listen to you .  I wouldn't do that .  But I like the feeling . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
