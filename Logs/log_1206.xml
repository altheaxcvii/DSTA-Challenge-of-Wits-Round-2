Second , you stood me up on the Valentine's Day .  I'm very sorry for that , but I sent you several messages to explain , my mom was seriously ill , and I had to look afer her .  But I ended up with finding out lady that night , that you were with other girl at cafe near your home .  That girl was my cousin .  You've got so many cousins . I called you later that night . But you didn't have the guts to answer the phone .  I didn't take my cellphone with me at that time .  I don't buy a story .  I know you don't hear me right know , please calm down . Anyway , I don't wanna part . I'll drop by tomorrow .  No , don't , I don't want to see you anymore . Don't ever call me again . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
