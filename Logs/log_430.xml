I just saw you throw a piece of garbage on the ground . Can't you read the No Littering sign ? It's a $ 500 penalty for littering , so go pick it up and put it in the garbage can over there .  Why should I do that ? It's only a piece of garbage . Why should you care ?  Because this is a public place , and I want to spend my time here without having to look at your garbage .  Listen , I really don't know why you're making this into such a big issue . It's only a small piece of garbage in a large space . It's not like there's garbage everywhere . Besides , someone will come along to clean it up at some time or another .  It's not the cleaner's responsibility to pick up after lazy people . It's part of your responsibility to make sure that the place is neat for other people . If everyone thought like you , there'd be garbage everywhere ! The cleaners can't be everywhere !  Ok , whatever . See , I'm putting it in the garbage can .  Hold on , that's an item . You should put that in the recycle bin next to the trashcan . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
