I ’ m sure we could get one or two tv companies to come in . Perhaps the president could invite them and do an interview .  That ’ s a good idea . We could put up some posters in and around the campus with a list of events . It would be quite cheap to do on the campus .  It will be expensive to do outside the campus . Perhaps we could arrange for some sponsorship .  We could contact alumni who work for large , well-know companies . They might be able to arrange cheap advertising in exchange for some free tickets .  Good thinking ! We should also print some leaflets for students to distribute .  We should put some information about it on the home page of our university website . When people visit the website , they ’ ll see the information .  We could take out some advertisements to local newspapers . I checked the prices and they are reasonable .  Ok . Let ’ s get to work on our advertising campaign . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
