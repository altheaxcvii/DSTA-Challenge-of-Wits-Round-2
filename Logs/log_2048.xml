Daddy is going to teach you how to play !  Cool !  Ok , each player gets 16 pieces . You can be the white ones and I ’ ll play with the black pieces . Now in the front , you set up the pawns . Those are the least valuable pieces and can only move one space forward . When you are about to capture another piece , it can move one space diagonally .  What about all these other pieces ?  See this one that looks like a tower ? It ’ s called the rook . The one with the tall hat is called the bishop . See this little horsey ? This is called the knight , it ’ s a very important piece so it ’ s best to not let your opponent capture it .  And these two ? They are husband and wife ?  That ’ s right ! That ’ s the queen and that ’ s the king . If the other player captures your king , he will say ” Check Mate ” and the game is over ! Doesn ’ t this sound fun ?  Nah ! This is boring ! I ’ m gonna go play Killer Zombies on my PlayStation ! </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
