It is a pretty big mechanical company . I am assigned to work in the assembly shop .  How long will you work a day ?  My working hours aren ’ t fixed , sometimes I do the day shift , sometimes the night shift . In all , about 8 hours .  That ’ s rather hard .  But it matches my major .  How will you get your pay ?  My wage depends on production results .  What sort of welfare facilities does your company provide ?  The company provides labor insurance for all employees , as well as fine retirement policy .  Is there a union ?  There is the company union , but it really shares the same aims as the management .  So you must consider dearly before you go to work .  I will . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
