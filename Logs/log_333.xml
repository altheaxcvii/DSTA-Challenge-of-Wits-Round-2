Well , I ’ Ve been meaning to talk to you about the situation in the office .  But I ’ m not in there very often . It ’ s so noisy that I can ’ t work .  That ’ s exactly what I ’ m getting at . We ’ re supposed to be able to do our preparation and marking in that office , but have you noticed ? Jack constantly has students coming in to get help with his course . A lot people are going in and out .  Has anybody spoken to him about it ?  No , not yet , but someone ’ s going to have to .  We really can ’ t ask him to stop having students come in for help , can we ?  No , of course not . But I ’ m not able to do my work and neither are you .  How about recommending him to use the storage room down the hall ?  Oh , that would be too small .  With the cabinets taken out , it might be bigger than it looks .  Come to think of it , you may be on to something . Let ’ s go have a look .  Let's rock n ' roll . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
