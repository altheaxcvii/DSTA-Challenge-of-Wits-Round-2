If you're a chocolate lover who's looking for some variety, you'll be overwhelmed and satisfied. Looking for gelato in the warmer months? Head to the back fo the store for something delicious! There's really not much else to the store other than a great selection of chocolates from nearly every corner of the globe.\n\nThe negatives are the service and the prices. Some of the chocolates that you'll find at Mon Aimee can be found significantly cheaper at places like Wegman's (if you're lucky enough to live near one), and we've spent a premium on certain candies in the past that we knew we could get cheaper elsewhere. Sometimes the convenience is worth it, though.\n\nAs for the service, it's a mixed bag. Generally, I've had trouble getting service when looking at the chocolates in the cases, and the staff never seems to be in a friendly mood. While I GUESS they're doing their customers a favor by procuring such a vast variety of chocolate, I'm not sure they should ACT like they're doing us a favor by existing. This strange air of arrogance has always been a turnoff, but what can I say...they have delicious treats;)</convo> <class></class></data>
