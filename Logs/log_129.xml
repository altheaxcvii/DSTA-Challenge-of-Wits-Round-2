I'd like to meet you , but I'm sorry I really can't .  Are you telling me you're not going to meet with me ?  Not at all , sir . I'd just like to delay our meeting to next week , I'll have time at the beginning of next week .  Well , I don't like it , but I guess I don't have any choice .  How about Monday morning at 9 a . m . ?  OK , I'll go to your office at that time . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
