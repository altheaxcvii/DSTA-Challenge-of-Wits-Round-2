Do you know what kind of scent she usually wears ?  She usually doesn't wear anything but a few drops of Chanel No . 5 . But I'd like to buy her a new Fragrance .  OK , here are some of our most popular perfumes .  Which one would you recommend ?  Personally , I quite like the new perfume from Clinique . It's a subtle flowery scent . What do you think ?  That smells great . I'll take one bottle , please .  Would you like to buy any other cosmetics for your girlfriend ? We have a full range of products from cosmetics to skin cleansers and moisturizers .  It's OK . She normally just wears a little foundation and some loose powder , and I don't know what shade to buy .  How about some lipstick ? Every woman needs a nice tube of lipstick .  She doesn't usually wear lipstick . She thinks it makes her nose look too big .  How about some mascara ? That will make her eyes look bigger .  No , thank you . She has big enough eyes as it is .  I know what she would like-some whitening cream .  No thanks . Western women usually try to make their skin darker , not lighter .  Will that be all then ?  That will be all . You've been very helpful , thanks . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
