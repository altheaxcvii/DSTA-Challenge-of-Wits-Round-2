But the guidebook says a lot of the stars come here.If we are spending three days in Hollywood , I want to see at least one star .  I think we might not see any .  Did you like the tour of Universal Studios ?  I thought it was O . K . But it really was too hot.And I think they should show people more . The exhibits should be more interesting .  I thought it was great . Didn't you like the special effects rooms ?  Yes , but I still think it could be better . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
