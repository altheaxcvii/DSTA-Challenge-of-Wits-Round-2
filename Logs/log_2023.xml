<?xml version ="1.0" encoding ="UTF-8" ?><data><location>259,121</location> <convo>Well , that's it . 7 appointments in Paris at beginning of next week , and 4 in Frankfurt at the end of the week .  It's certainly a tight schedule .  Now it's a question of getting there . I need a flight to Paris on Sunday evening and a hotel in Paris for 3 nights . I have to be in Frankfurt by 11 on Thursday morning . And I will need a hotel for one night . I will head home on Friday .  At what time ?  My last appointment is at 3 , so I should be free by 5 at the very latest . I think I could get to the airport by 6 .  Do you know how far you will be from the airport at 5 ?  No , not really .  So you are not sure how long it will take to get there ?  No , but I am sure it won't take more than an hour .  Don't forget it's Friday nighty . If Frankfurt's anything like London , everybody will be leaving for the weekend . It will be a rush hour and traffic might be moving very slowly .  You are a pessimist .  I am a realist . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
