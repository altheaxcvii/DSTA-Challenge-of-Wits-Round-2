Thank you very much . Can I work now ?  Oh . Take it easy . As I ’ Ve said in the interview , once you are employed , we ’ ll give you a probation period of three months . And now we need to sign a draft agreement for the probation period .  I am sorry , I am just too excited and forget it . Can I look it through ?  Of course , here you are . And you can ask me any question .  Well , I am sorry that I have a question . There is no remuneration item in this agreement . Can you tell me something about it ?  Well , according to the principle of our company , employees like you have no remuneration during the probation period .  But you didn ’ t tell me in the interview .  I am sorry , it ’ s not decided by me but by the company .  Okay , I can ’ t decide whether sign or not now . Can you give me some time to think it over ?  Okay . Can you give me a reply tomorrow ?  Yes . Thank you very much . Mr . Yang . </convo> <class>casual</class></data>
