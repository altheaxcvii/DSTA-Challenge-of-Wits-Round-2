Have you got your performance evaluations finished yet ?  Oh no ! Evaluations ! You can tell that's not my favorite job ; I haven't even started yet . When is the deadline for turning in thecompleted forms ?  Well , you do still have three weeks . But remember the employee must sign them , too . Filling them in is nothing - it's meetingwith the employees that takes so much time .  I never know how to rate the employees ' work . Of course attendance and productivity are easy , I just look at the sales figures .  So it's the subjective criteria like team building and colleague support that you find hard ?  Exactly ! Attitude ... how do you rate attitude ?  I suggest letting each employee fill out his or her own evaluation for those items . Then , based on their self - assessment , you can add your comments . It's a great starting point for discussion  Great idea . And after all , that's the whole point of an evaluation . I almost can't wait to give it a try . </convo> <class>official</class></data>
